I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Chemistry](https://cm.utexas.edu/) at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), working under the supervision of [Prof. Yi-Chih Lin](https://sites.google.com/utexas.edu/yichihlin-lab/). My research focuses on **single-molecule biophysics**, where I use **high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM)** and **cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM/cryo-ET)** to investigate the structure and dynamics of biomolecules at the nanoscale.

My current research projects include real-time visualization of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and their interactions with neutralizing antibodies, structural studies of SARS-CoV-2 membrane proteins, and investigating DNA repair mechanisms through single-molecule imaging. This research is supported by an NIH Maximizing Investigators' Research Award.

Prior to joining UT Austin, I obtained my Master's degree from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) (advised by [Prof. Chunyan Tan](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/tcy_en/main.htm)), where I developed fluorescence sensor arrays for discriminating amyloid beta aggregates. I received my Bachelor's degree from [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/), where I worked on organic synthesis and catalysis with [Prof. Pengfei Li](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=lipf&go=1&lang=en).
