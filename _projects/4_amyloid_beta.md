Developed a cross-reactive fluorescence sensor array for rapid and accurate discrimination of different aggregation states of amyloid beta 42 (Aβ42) peptide, which is closely associated with Alzheimer's disease.

#### Key Contributions

- Prepared different aggregation states of **amyloid beta peptide** and characterized them using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and CD spectrometer
- Discriminated different aggregation states using a **fluorescence sensor array** containing conjugated polyelectrolytes and small molecules, analyzed by **PCA and LDA** algorithms (Matlab)
- Prepared on-pathway and off-pathway aggregates by adding various stimuli, and discriminated them using the constructed sensor array
- Explored **aggregation kinetics** using the constructed fluorescence sensor array
