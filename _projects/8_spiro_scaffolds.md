Developed a catalyst-free [3+2] cycloaddition reaction to access spiro[chroman-3,2'-indene-1',3'-dione] scaffolds incorporating two biologically active moieties.

#### Key Contributions

- Constructed a facile **[3+2] cycloaddition reaction** to obtain spiro[chroman-3,2'-indene-1',3'-dione] which incorporates two biologically active scaffolds
- Achieved **high yields** without the need for catalysts or complex operations
- Characterized products by **NMR, HPLC, and X-ray crystallography**
