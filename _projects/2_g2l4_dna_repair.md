This project uses HS-AFM to investigate how G2L4 reverse transcriptase participates in DNA repair through the microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) pathway.

#### Key Contributions

- Investigated single-molecule structure and dynamics of **G2L4 and DNA substrates (MMEJ)** using HS-AFM
- Visualized binding modes of G2L4 and MMEJ substrates using HS-AFM
- Uncovered **diverse DNA repair products** and potential repair mechanisms
- Studied **DNA ligation** of DNA products using T4 ligase
