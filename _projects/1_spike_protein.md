This project focuses on real-time visualization and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and their interactions with host receptors and therapeutic antibodies at the single-molecule level.

#### Key Contributions

- Visualized single spike protein, ACE2, and neutralizing antibody (NTD binder) using **high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM)** and compared with simulated AFM images
- Analyzed **single-molecule dynamics** of neutralizing antibody binding
- Investigated **intermolecular interactions** between spike protein and neutralizing antibody in real time
