Developed an enantioselective phosphine-catalyzed [1+4] annulation methodology for the synthesis of chiral 2-pyrrolines from Morita-Baylis-Hillman (MBH) carbonates and α,β-unsaturated imines.

#### Key Contributions

- Established an **organic methodology** using phosphine catalyst for [4+1] cycloaddition of unsaturated imine and MBH ester with a wide range of substituent groups
- Obtained **chiral 2-pyrrolines** with high yields and good enantioselectivities
- Proficient use of **glove box** for synthesis, column chromatography for purification, and **HPLC/NMR** for product characterization
