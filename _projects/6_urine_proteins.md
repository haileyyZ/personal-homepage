Contributed to constructing a fluorescence sensor array capable of discriminating urine proteins for differentiation diagnosis of urinary system diseases.

#### Key Contributions

- Constructed a **three-unit fluorescence sensor array** and realized discrimination of six common urine proteins, their different concentrations, and complex mixtures
- Processed real urine samples with **centrifugation, filtration, and dialysis**
- Distinguished protein profiles of urine samples from healthy people and patients with different urinary diseases, such as **tubular injury, diabetic nephropathy, and nephropathy**
