**Advisor:** Prof. Chunyan Tan

Developed fluorescent probes based on conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) for detecting histone acetylation-related enzymes, p300 (acetyltransferase) and SIRT1 (deacetylase).

#### Key Contributions

- Synthesized conjugated polymer **PPE-IDA** through Sonogashira coupling and characterized spectroscopic properties
- Designed **polylysine peptide substrates** of acetylation-related enzymes (p300 and SIRT1) and explored their interaction with several conjugated polyelectrolytes
- Explored the **optimal catalytic conditions** of enzymes
- Utilized peptide-polymer probes to detect **p300 and SIRT1** activity
