**Advisor:** Prof. Yi-Chih Lin | **Collaboration:** Dr. Zunlong Ke lab (cryo-ET)

This project investigates the structure and assembly of SARS-CoV-2 membrane (M) proteins, which play a critical role in viral assembly and budding.

#### Key Contributions

- Prepared and characterized **membrane protein in E. coli expression system**
- Reconstituted membrane proteins in lipid and visualized the formation of **membrane protein lattice** using HS-AFM and TEM
- Visualized membrane protein proteoliposomes using **cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET)** in collaboration with Dr. Zunlong Ke lab
